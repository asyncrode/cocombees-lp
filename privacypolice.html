						<p>11. <b>Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)</b>
						</p>
						<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online
							services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to
							require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates
							websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a
							conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected
							and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.</p>
						<p>According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:</p>
						<p>0.1. users can visit our site anonymously;</p>
						<p>0.2. our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the home
							page of our website;</p>
						<p>0.3. users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;</p>
						<p>0.4. users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at
							<b>cocombeesg17@gmail.com</b>.
						</p>
						<p>Our Policy on “Do Not Track” Signals:</p>
						<p>We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do
							Not Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your
							web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked.</p>
						<p>You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your
							web browser.</p>
						<p>12. <b>Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</b></p>
						<p>If you are a California resident, you are entitled to learn what data we collect about you,
							ask to delete your data and not to sell (share) it. To exercise your data protection rights,
							you can make certain requests and ask us:</p>
						<p><b>0.1. What personal information we have about you. If you make this request, we will return
								to you:</b></p>
						<p>0.0.1. The categories of personal information we have collected about you.</p>
						<p>0.0.2. The categories of sources from which we collect your personal information.</p>
						<p>0.0.3. The business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling your personal
							information.</p>
						<p>0.0.4. The categories of third parties with whom we share personal information.</p>
						<p>0.0.5. The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.</p>
						<p>0.0.6. A list of categories of personal information that we have sold, along with the
							category of any other company we sold it to. If we have not sold your personal information,
							we will inform you of that fact.</p>
						<p>0.0.7. A list of categories of personal information that we have disclosed for a business
							purpose, along with the category of any other company we shared it with.</p>
						<p>Please note, you are entitled to ask us to provide you with this information up to two times
							in a rolling twelve-month period. When you make this request, the information provided may
							be limited to the personal information we collected about you in the previous 12 months.</p>
						<p><b>0.2. To delete your personal information. If you make this request, we will delete the
								personal information we hold about you as of the date of your request from our records
								and direct any service providers to do the same. In some cases, deletion may be
								accomplished through de-identification of the information. If you choose to delete your
								personal information, you may not be able to use certain functions that require your
								personal information to operate.</b></p>
						<p><b>0.3. To stop selling your personal information. We don’t sell or rent your personal
								information to any third parties for any purpose. We do not sell your personal
								information for monetary consideration. However, under some circumstances, a transfer of
								personal information to a third party, or within our family of companies, without
								monetary consideration may be considered a “sale” under California law. You are the only
								owner of your Personal Data and can request disclosure or deletion at any time.</b></p>
						<p>If you submit a request to stop selling your personal information, we will stop making such
							transfers.</p>
						<p>Please note, if you ask us to delete or stop selling your data, it may impact your experience
							with us, and you may not be able to participate in certain programs or membership services
							which require the usage of your personal information to function. But in no circumstances,
							we will discriminate against you for exercising your rights.</p>
						<p>To exercise your California data protection rights described above, please send your
							request(s) by email: <b>cocombeesg17@gmail.com</b>.</p>
						<p>Your data protection rights, described above, are covered by the CCPA, short for the
							California Consumer Privacy Act. To find out more, visit the official California Legislative
							Information website. The CCPA took effect on 01/01/2020.</p>
						<p>13. <b>Service Providers</b></p>
						<p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service (<b>“Service
								Providers”</b>), provide Service on our behalf, perform Service-related services or
							assist us in analysing how our Service is used.</p>
						<p>These third parties have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our
							behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>
						<p>14. <b>Analytics</b></p>
						<p>We may use third-party Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our Service.</p>

						<p>We may use third-party Service Providers to automate the development process of our Service.
						</p>
						<p>16. <b>Advertising</b></p>
						<p>We may use third-party Service Providers to show advertisements to you to help support and
							maintain our Service.</p>
						<p>17. <b>Behavioral Remarketing</b></p>
						<p>We may use remarketing services to advertise on third party websites to you after you visited
							our Service. We and our third-party vendors use cookies to inform, optimise and serve ads
							based on your past visits to our Service.</p>

						<p>18. <b>Links to Other Sites</b></p>
						<p>Our Service may contain links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click a
							third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s site. We strongly advise you to
							review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit.</p>
						<p>We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or
							practices of any third party sites or services.</p>

						<p>19. <b><b>Children’s Privacy</b></b></p>
						<p>Our Services are not intended for use by children under the age of 18 (<b>“Child”</b> or
							<b>“Children”</b>).
